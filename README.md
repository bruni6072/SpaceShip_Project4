# SpaceShip_Project4
###### This is  Project 4, released for the Swansea University MSc Virtual Reality.

**Sound and Light**
------
#### **Sound**
A buzzing sound was added to some parts of the spaceship where the user is closer to the exterior, like the windows or the end of a corridor. The sound of sparks was also added to a spark animation. Since an alarm can be set off in the spaceship, an alarm sound was included with an additional Spaceship Assistant voice that simulates that is going through the systems and checking for possible damages.

#####

#### **Light**
There are different types of lights set in the scene, the user is first presented with a simple blue/white light that covers all the spaceship after the user triggers the fire alarm the blue/white lights turn off and an animation of green lights is set off (simulating an alarm). The last type of “lights” are holograms, which are not lights but a texture/material that emits light.
